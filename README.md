In the golden age of the boilerplate, here are my various frontend boilerplates:

* [master](https://github.com/wfro/frontend-boilerplates/tree/master): Vanilla ES2015, mocha/chai
* [react-redux-hmr-client-only (this branch)](https://github.com/wfro/frontend-boilerplates/tree/react-redux-hmr-client-only): client-only react/redux
* [planned but not added yet](): react/redux with some kind of JS backend

# React/redux/hmr (client-only)

My boilerplate for React/Express.

Want:

- [x] React
- [ ] React-router
- [x] Redux
- [ ] Karma + in-browser tests
- [x] Linting
- [x] HMR via webpack-hot-middleware
- [x] Production builds
