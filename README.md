Here are my various frontend boilerplates.  You'll probably want to delete the `.git` directory and start from scratch with your own repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:wfro/frontend-boilerplates.git
cd frontend-boilerplates
rm -rf .git
git init
```

There are several branches:

* [master](https://github.com/wfro/frontend-boilerplates/tree/master): Vanilla ES2015, mocha/chai
* [react-redux-hmr-client-only](https://github.com/wfro/frontend-boilerplates/tree/react-redux-hmr-client-only): client-only react/redux
* [universal](https://github.com/wfro/frontend-boilerplates/tree/universal): react/express

# React/redux/hmr (client-only)
