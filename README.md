In the golden age of the boilerplate, here are my various frontend boilerplates:

* [master](https://github.com/wfro/frontend-boilerplates/tree/master): Vanilla ES2015, mocha/chai
* [react-redux-hmr-client-only (this branch)](https://github.com/wfro/frontend-boilerplates/tree/react-redux-hmr-client-only): client-only react/redux
* [planned but not added yet](): react/redux with some kind of JS backend

# React/redux/hmr (client-only)

TODO:

- [ ] React-router
- [ ] Karma
- [x] in-browser tests
